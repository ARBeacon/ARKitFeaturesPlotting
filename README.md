# ARKitFeaturesPlotting

A Python Jupyter notebook for analyzing and visualizing ARKit feature point data.

## Processes JSON files from [`ARKitPointCloudRecorder`](https://github.com/ARBeacon/ARKitPointCloudRecorder) to:

- Calculate inter-session feature point distances.
- Generate statistical summaries (mean, standard deviation).
- Plot 3D feature point matches and interactive visualizations.
